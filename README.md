# NPO-Start-Downloader
NO LONGER WORKING
Note that this code is many years out of date and doesn't work anymore. I'm keeping it up here in case I ever want to work on it again.


Allows for NPO Start tv programs to be downloaded by right-clicking the video or using other tools.  Episode titles can't be added to the filename automatically so a string containing title, date, and subtitle (if exists) are copied to clipboard.
